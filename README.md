<h2>User Experience</h2>

<h3>Project planning</h3>   
<p>After reading though the options for my first portfolio project I decided to create a website based on something that I have a real instrest an passion for, Earths oceans. I believe that there can never be enough awareness of maintaining a clean and healthy ocean. </p>

<p><strong>Research:</strong> Determining potentional website users, I decided on the surfing community.  The surfing community spans globally and all share a special connection with ocean and understand the importance of keeping it clean.</p>

<p><strong>User:</strong> As a user and gowning up and living near different oceans around the world I would like to know how I can encourage and contribute to bring awerness in creating change on maintaining a clean and healthy ocean.</p>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Wave Guard's website will display a direct navigation focusing on three section: Home, Gallery, and Signup sections, providing seamless navigation. Each section will be accessable by using clearly displayed navigation links that will be displayed when scrolling between section. The website's home page will display an inpiratonal image and message. Information in the gallery section will provide images and clear description when provided by users to display their contribution to clean beaches and oceans. Method to signup should be easy and direct in becoming a member of the Wave Guard</p>

<h3>Strutural planning</h3>

<p>To achieve the websits goal of spreading globally it was detemined to create a website with four section: Home, Gallery, Signup and Contact. </P>
